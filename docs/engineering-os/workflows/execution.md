# Task Execution and Harness Parity

## Purpose and authority

This workflow defines what makes an authorized Task Contract executable by any harness, how a harness is assigned to a task, and how writable execution is isolated.

It is vendor-neutral: Claude Code, Codex, and other harnesses consume the same rules and approval boundaries.

```text
TASK CONTRACT
  → HARNESS ASSIGNMENT
  → PARALLELISM ASSESSMENT
  → TASK WORKTREE
  → EXECUTION
  → BUILD REPORT
```

The Planner does not select a vendor/model. Harness assignment remains an orchestration or human responsibility unless a later approved routing contract says otherwise.

Writable execution follows [`worktree-execution.md`](worktree-execution.md). Reviewer feedback/repair follows [`review-feedback-and-repair.md`](review-feedback-and-repair.md). Git publication and the final human merge boundary follow [`git-publishing-and-human-merge.md`](git-publishing-and-human-merge.md).

## Why parity matters

A harness is an execution environment, not a source of rules. The same Task Contract picked up by a different harness must be governed by the same Core, produce the same evidence, and stop at the same gates.

Two common failures break parity:

- **Divergent bootstrap.** The adapters reach different documents, so one executor holds a guardrail the other does not.
- **Context outside the contract.** A task is executable only because of something said in a conversation or established in an earlier session that the other harness or Reviewer cannot access.

## Portability requirements

A Task Contract is portable when all of the following hold:

1. **Self-contained.** Goal, scope, out of scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, required capabilities, validation classification, and sources to read are in the contract.
2. **Commands are real and named.** Validation profiles carry the project's actual commands.
3. **Baseline is declared.** The executor knows which failures already exist.
4. **Scope is bounded.** Adjacent work that must not be touched is explicit.
5. **Gates are named.** Required Design Approval, browser/runtime validation, Git publication, and Human Merge gates are declared when applicable.
6. **Report format is fixed.** The complete `BUILD REPORT` from the Builder contract is required.
7. **Capabilities are verifiable.** Pre-flight checks can be performed from the contract and project context.
8. **Execution ownership is attributable.** The task branch/worktree and active Builder ownership are unambiguous for writable execution.

A contract that fails these requirements is `TASK_CONTRACT_NOT_PORTABLE`. Record what is missing; do not repair it only inside private execution context.

## Harness assignment

Assignment is recorded independently from the frozen execution plan:

```text
HARNESS ASSIGNMENT

task_id: <value>
harness: <value>
assigned_by: <human-or-authorized-router>
rationale: <value>
```

Rules:

- one task has one active writable executor at a time;
- assignment does not change scope;
- a harness may not use capabilities the contract/project did not grant;
- reassignment after execution begins preserves prior evidence and is recorded when it changes planned execution.

## Writable execution isolation

A task with `WRITE` capability SHOULD execute in a dedicated branch and dedicated worktree according to [`worktree-execution.md`](worktree-execution.md).

Default invariant:

```text
one task
  → one branch
  → one writable worktree
  → one active Builder
```

The primary checkout SHOULD remain clean and primarily track/synchronize `main` rather than serve as the writable implementation environment for multiple tasks.

## Concurrent execution

Two tasks may execute concurrently only after their relationship has been classified:

```text
SAFE_TO_PARALLELIZE
PARALLELISM_RISK
DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED
```

`SAFE_TO_PARALLELIZE` permits execution in separate worktrees.

`PARALLELISM_RISK` requires explicit resolution before concurrent writable execution.

`DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED` means one task must wait for another task, artifact, migration, Design Approval, or architectural decision.

Worktree isolation prevents Git-state collisions; it does not prove architectural independence, and it does not isolate shared external state. Tasks that write to the same database, object store, broker, or scratch directory are concurrent writers to one resource however separate their worktrees are; see [`worktree-execution.md`](worktree-execution.md).

Each parallel task keeps a distinct Builder Report and Review Evidence Package. Do not merge multiple task reports into a summary that loses attribution.

## Interface changes

For `INTERFACE_CHANGE`, writable implementation must not begin before the required Design Approval Package receives explicit human approval.

A worktree may be created earlier for preparation, but its existence is not authorization to build the surface.

After implementation, browser/runtime validation follows [`browser-runtime-validation.md`](browser-runtime-validation.md).

## Automatic implementation feedback loop

Independent review is part of execution, not a human approval boundary.

```text
Builder
  ↓
local/browser validation
  ↓
Reviewer
  ├─ REVIEW_PASS → continue
  ├─ REVIEW_FINDINGS → classify → Builder repair ↺
  └─ REVIEW_EVIDENCE_INCOMPLETE → recover evidence → Reviewer ↺
```

`REVIEW_FINDINGS` and `REVIEW_EVIDENCE_INCOMPLETE` MUST NOT automatically stop the harness for a human.

The harness follows [`review-feedback-and-repair.md`](review-feedback-and-repair.md): in-scope defects and evidence deficiencies are repaired automatically within a bounded loop. A human is called only for a genuine approval/scope/decision boundary, unavailable required capability/evidence, unsafe preexisting-work conflict, or exhausted feedback iterations.

Default review feedback budget:

```text
max_review_feedback_iterations = 3
```

`feedback_iterations` is separate from `ci_repair_iterations`.

## Publishing and merge boundary

When validation and review permit publication, the harness may create focused commits, push the task branch, open/update the PR, and publish evidence as defined in [`git-publishing-and-human-merge.md`](git-publishing-and-human-merge.md).

The normal integration path is:

```text
Task worktree
  ↓
Builder + deterministic validation
  ↓
Reviewer repair loop until REVIEW_PASS
  ↓
commit + push
  ↓
Pull Request
  ↓
required remote CI + bounded CI repair loop
  ↓
CI_GREEN
  ↓
READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW
  ↓
HUMAN MERGE
```

The harness MUST NOT merge the task branch into local `main` as a substitute for the PR gate.

## Post-merge cleanup

After a human merges the PR, synchronize the primary local `main`, then remove the merged task worktree/branch only when cleanup is safe.

The detailed cleanup contract and safety checks are in [`worktree-execution.md`](worktree-execution.md).

## Evidence parity

Regardless of harness:

- every Builder round ends with a complete `BUILD REPORT`;
- every materially changed review revision receives a new Reviewer round;
- validation executed is distinguished from validation skipped;
- browser/runtime evidence is present when required;
- `feedback_iterations` and `ci_repair_iterations` are attributable and distinct;
- branch/worktree ownership and final commit/PR references are attributable when writable execution occurred;
- the harness is recorded as execution context, never as a reason a requirement did not apply;
- a missing or incomplete report remains `BUILDER_CONTRACT_INCOMPLETE` even when code appears correct.

If comparable harness executions produce materially different evidence for the same requirement, record a contract/adapter finding rather than preferring the nicer-looking output.

## Anti-patterns

- **Harness as rule set:** letting harness defaults decide policy.
- **Verbal task:** requirements exist only in conversation.
- **Invented command:** validation uses a plausible but unverified command.
- **Shared writable checkout:** parallel Builders mutate the same worktree/index.
- **Worktree equals safe parallelism:** assuming filesystem isolation proves dependency independence.
- **Shared external state:** concurrent tasks writing one database, object store, broker, or scratch directory. The collision surfaces as a failing test in a task that did not cause it, not as a merge conflict.
- **Reviewer as human gate:** stopping for a person on an in-scope defect the Builder can repair automatically.
- **Silent reassignment:** executor changes without evidence.
- **Local-main integration:** task branch is merged locally to bypass the PR/Human Gate.
- **Unsafe cleanup:** deleting a worktree/branch with uncommitted work or an unmerged task.
- **Merged evidence:** one report hides distinct task/executor provenance.
- **Capability drift:** using a capability simply because the harness exposes it.

## Evolution to automatic worker routing

Future orchestration may automatically select workers from declared capabilities. That changes assignment mechanics, not the execution contract.

A future router must still preserve:

- Task Contract portability;
- parallelism/dependency classification;
- one writable ownership per task;
- dedicated branch/worktree isolation;
- Builder/Reviewer evidence parity;
- automatic bounded Reviewer repair;
- browser/runtime evidence when required;
- harness-prepared PR;
- human-only merge authority.

Adding or replacing a worker must not require changing Core engineering policy.
